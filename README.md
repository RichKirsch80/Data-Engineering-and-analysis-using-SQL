Goals - Data Engineering and analysis answers employee based questions by creating a database from six separate csv files. QuickDBD displays data type and relationship between each table as well as primary and foreign keys. Created sql files for both the table creation and employee query list. 

Included files:
QuickDBD-export.png is an image file of the ERD.

create_table a .sql file of the table schemata.

Data Modeling
Inspected the CSVs and sketched out an ERD of the tables. 

Data Engineering
Used the information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. 
Imported each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

Data Analysis on the completed database:

Listed the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
